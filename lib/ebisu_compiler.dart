/// 
/// Supports generating dart code from template files.  A choice had to be made
/// about a templating system. Originally dart had a library to support templates
/// but it was later abandoned in preference for a new approach (_Web UI_) that does
/// much more than just templating as it is a very web specific solution. Mustache
/// is another good option, but for code generation the arguments for separating
/// templates and logic fall apart (the coders are the ones writing the templates to
/// make their life of coding easier). Rather than try to incorporate one in NIH/DIY
/// fashion a very simple template engine is provided here. The rules for templating
/// are simple:
///
/// - Template file is line based (each line is a comment, code or template text)
/// - _#<# dart comment here >_
/// - _#< dart code here >_
/// - All template text is wrapped in tripple quotes.
///
